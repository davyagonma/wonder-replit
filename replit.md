## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing a component-based architecture with:
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives for accessible, customizable interfaces
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens optimized for educational branding (warm oranges and professional blues)
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state management with optimistic updates
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling

### Backend Architecture
The server follows a RESTful Express.js architecture with:
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript and ESM modules
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints for enrollment requests and contact messages
- **Request Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and validation
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based storage layer supporting both in-memory (development) and database implementations

### Data Storage
The application uses a flexible storage architecture:
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via Neon Database serverless)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations with shared schema definitions
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for rapid development
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

### Build and Development
The build system leverages Vite for optimal development experience:
- **Bundling**: Vite for frontend with esbuild for backend production builds
- **Development**: Hot module replacement and error overlays
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking across the entire codebase
- **Path Aliases**: Organized imports with @/ for client code and @shared/ for shared utilities

### Key Design Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between client, server, and shared code
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with shared types and Zod validation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful fallbacks and accessible design patterns
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop viewing
